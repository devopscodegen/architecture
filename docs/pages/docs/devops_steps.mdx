## DevOps steps

- Each organization, organizational unit, library, application, tool, middleware, microservice, data pipeline, dashboard, etc. is a component. We need code repository, CI/CD pipeline, artifact repositories and other DevOps infrastructure resources for each component.

- Infrastructure as code components.
  - Terraform.
  - Ansible.
  - REST API ( Use mastercard terraform rest api provider )
  - Jenkins Configuration as Code (a.k.a. JCasC) Plugin.

<Steps>

### Algorithm

- Create google account examplebank.azure@gmail.com
- Create azure cloud account with email examplebank.azure@gmail.com
- Create VM with minikube, fluxcd, tofu controller and opentofu inside this account
- Add a terraform resource which is watching a directory which creates below
  - examplebank organization
    - nonprod organizational unit and vm
      - In this vm, add terraform resource which creates
        - devops organizational unit and vm
    - prod organizational unit and vm
      - In this vm, add terraform resource which creates
        - devops organizational unit and vm
          - In this vm, add terraform resource which creates
            - aks cluster with argocd
            - argocd should then install required controllers, jenkins and gitea with examplebank, examplebank-nonprod and examplebank-prod organizations.
            - devops-gitea GitOps repository needs to be created in gitea examplebank-prod organization
            - devops-github GitOps repository needs to be created in github examplebank-prod organization
- Terraform VMs should wait for this devops-github repository to be created and once it is created, checkin the github repository creation code and once the github source code repository for examplebank, nonprod, prod and devops are created, it should checkin the fluxcd and terraform code to them. 
- Terraform VMs should also do the same for jenkins so that CI/CD pipelines are created and triggered which will copy the terraform code to devops-jenkins and devops-github GitOps repositories. We cannot use fluxcd pointing to individual gitops repository since gitops repository does not exist and jenkins CI/CD pipeline does not exist to copy the code to the GitOps repository.
- We can do Jenkins+Gitea and Github Actions+Github.

### GitOps repositories

- For bootstrapping, no need to use dc01. We can use management account of one of the clouds like aws, azure or gcp.
- We do not need to use Jenkins for bootstrapping CI/CD pipeline since the CI/CD pipeline will just checkout and checkin the infrastructure code to gitops repositories. We dont have other tools like linters, artifact repository, etc. available so we dont need to use Jenkins. We can just use Github actions or similar CI/CD tool of the code repository provider cloud. 
- During bootstrapping, we can use flux cd terraform of management account of one of the clouds to create and maintain the github repositories and then transfer the responsibility of these github repositories to the devops prod account flux cd terraform of the same cloud.
- After creating organization, first OU we should create is devops and also create all the components of devops like devops-jenkins, devops-github, devops-nexusrm, devops-sonarqube, etc. so that we can start managing the other components using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines instead of code repository provider cloud CI/CD pipeline tool like Github actions.
- Create nonprod and prod OUs and then create devops, testing, orgunit01 and other OUs inside them.
- We will use app of apps so that argocd manages its own apps. We dont need terraform to create the apps.
- Terraform should just create the kubernetes cluster, create argocd namespace and install argocd and create an app which points to a git repository which will contain application resources for all code that is deployed to the kubernetes cluster.
- Code repository directories in devops/infrastructure directory : ( No need for devops/container_deployment directory )
  - aws/orgunit01/eks/argocd -> orgunit01 repository aws/orgunit01/env/eks branch application resources argocd directory.
  - aws/orgunit01/eks/kubernetes -> orgunit01-app01-transfer repository aws/orgunit01/env/eks branch kubernetes directory.
  - aws/orgunit01/fluxcd -> orgunit01 repository aws/orgunit01/env branch terraform resources fluxcd directory.
  - aws/orgunit01/terraform -> orgunit01-app01-transfer repository aws/orgunit01/env branch terraform directory.
  - aws/devops/fluxcd -> devops repository aws/devops/nonprodX and aws/devops/prod branch fluxcd directory.
  - aws/devops/terraform -> orgunit01-app01-transfer repository aws/devops/nonprodX and aws/devops/prod  branch terraform directory.

### Kustomize helm charts

- Problem with helm charts is you cannot override the yaml if it is not part of values. To solve this problem, CI pipeline should use kustomize with helm charts.
- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/chart.md
- Use helm template command to convert helm chart to base yaml. Do not use helmCharts of kustomize as recommended by kustomize.
- Use kustomize transformers and overlays to generate final yaml
- Checkin the final yaml to GitOps repository.

```
helm template {releaseName} \
    --values {valuesFile} \
    --version {version} \
    --repo {repo} \
    {chartName} > {chartName}.yaml
```

kustomization.yaml

```
resources:
- minecraft_v3.1.3_Chart.yaml
```

### DAPR

https://docs.dapr.io

| Building Block | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Service-to-service invocation**  | Resilient service-to-service invocation enables method calls, including retries, on remote services, wherever they are located in the supported hosting environment.
| **Publish and subscribe** | Publishing events and subscribing to topics between services enables event-driven architectures to simplify horizontal scalability and make them resilient to failure. Dapr provides at-least-once message delivery guarantee, message TTL, consumer groups and other advance features.
| **Workflows** | The workflow API can be combined with other Dapr building blocks to define long running, persistent processes or data flows that span multiple microservices using Dapr workflows or workflow components. 
| **State management** | With state management for storing and querying key/value pairs, long-running, highly available, stateful services can be easily written alongside stateless services in your application. The state store is pluggable and examples include AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Server, GCP Firebase, PostgreSQL or Redis, among others.
| **Resource bindings** | Resource bindings with triggers builds further on event-driven architectures for scale and resiliency by receiving and sending events to and from any external source such as databases, queues, file systems, etc.
| **Actors** | A pattern for stateful and stateless objects that makes concurrency simple, with method and state encapsulation. Dapr provides many capabilities in its actor runtime, including concurrency, state, and life-cycle management for actor activation/deactivation, and timers and reminders to wake up actors.
| **Secrets** | The secrets management API integrates with public cloud and local secret stores to retrieve the secrets for use in application code.
| **Configuration**  | The configuration API enables you to retrieve and subscribe to application configuration items from configuration stores. 
| **Distributed lock**  | The distributed lock API enables your application to acquire a lock for any resource that gives it exclusive access until either the lock is released by the application, or a lease timeout occurs. 
| **Cryptography** | The cryptography API provides an abstraction layer on top of security infrastructure such as key vaults. It contains APIs that allow you to perform cryptographic operations, such as encrypting and decrypting messages, without exposing keys to your applications.
| **Jobs** | The jobs API enables you to schedule jobs at specific times or intervals.

### Equinix Colocation
- Install bare metal servers in equinix colocation
- IBX
- https://www.equinix.com/products/data-center-services/colocation
- https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Colocation-Products/colo-intro.htm

### Equinix fabric
- Use Equinix fabric for communication between your bare metal servers in equinix colocation and aws, azure, google and other clouds.
- https://www.equinix.com/products/digital-infrastructure-services/equinix-fabric
- https://docs.equinix.com/en-us/Content/Interconnection/Fabric/Fabric-landing-main.htm
- https://www.equinix.com/products/digital-infrastructure-services/equinix-fabric/provider-availability

### DevOps components reliability
- DevOps components like Cloudbees Jenkins will be initially installed in VMs or containers on the bare metal server in the Equinix colocation data center.
- Once they are used to create AWS, Azure and Google cloud infrastructure, they will be made highly available with Passive or Active strategies in these clouds. 
- For example, Jenkins in AWS needs to handle CI/CD pipelines which build and deploy components to AWS infrastructure. Jenkins in Azure needs to handle CI/CD pipelines which build and deploy components to Azure infrastructure.

### GitOps for CD
- Harness, Spinnaker for CI/CD and Morpheus Data, Cloudify for cloud management are hype. They dont have proper open source support
- Use Cloudbees Jenkins for CI, ArgoCD for Kubernetes CD and Hashicorp cloud platform Terraform, Vault, etc. for Infrastructure CD.
- All Kubernetes (Helm charts) and Infrastructure code along with environment configuration code will be checked into the code repository.
- It is responsibility of Jenkins to compile it and translate it into files which can be checked into the GitOps repository used by components like ArgoCD, Terraform, etc. using commands like helm template, terraform plan. Translated files should contain all the environment configuration variables part of the files.
  - Helm template -> Kubernetes yaml
  - Terraform tf -> Terraform plan. Use read only access to account for drift detection and plan generation.
  - Need to test if this is possible. Liquibase files -> sql. Use read only access to database for drift detection and sql generation.
- GitOps (PullOps vs PushOps)
  - The difference between Helm and Argo is the difference between Ansible and Puppet. Ansible applies the playbook when you tell it to run, and never actually does anything to ensure that state is conformed to until you run the playbook again. Puppet applies the manifest you define and perpetually ensures that state is applied until the end of time and automatically, immediately, corrects any changes that deviates from the manifest. Puppet is stateful enforcement. Ansible is setting a state but not enforcing it. Ansible is good. Puppet is great but is actually resilient and self-correcting.

  - Think of helm as push-ops and Argo as pull-ops. With push-ops, you often won't find out about any drift until the next time you try to push the latest state of the IaC repository. Sometimes that drift is important and can mean a lot of work for your team. With pull-ops, you can learn of any drift immediately as it occurs. Your argo app can be configured to automatically try to reconcile any drift back to the IaC state, or it can be configured to wait until manual intervention. It's up to you. The point is that you have the knowledge and the choice now.

- Deployment components like argocd, terraform, sql runner should run in the same account or kubernetes cluster or namespace where the infrastructure needs to be deployed and run when Jenkins updates the GitOps repository relevant branch. We can have one branch per component environment. Only Jenkins should have permission to update this GitOps repository.
- Terraform provider can be used to install argocd operator and create argocd applications in the kubernetes cluster and namespace.
- GitOps is more secure because Jenkins is not given access to do any deployment to any account. We can have single Jenkins for non production and production environments. It only has access to update GitOps repository.
- Also, we dont need to add code in Jenkins to run commands like helm install, terraform apply, liquibase deploy, etc.
- ArgoCD runs in the same namespace where kubernetes infrastructure needs to be deployed.
- We need to run terraform binary in the same account where we need to deploy the cloud infrastructure.
- Need to test if this is possible. Liquibase binary is not required since we need to just run sql statements. Use read only access to database for drift detection and sql generation. 
- We have separate accounts, clusters and namespaces for different environments of an organizational unit or component.
- We can use the GitOps repository for Static code analysis, FinOps and architecture visualization.
- ArgoCD, Terraform and SQL should also do periodic drift detection. GitOps repository should exactly match the infrastructure in account, cluster, namespace or database.
- Need to test if this is possible. Jenkins may still need to connect to infrastructure to install middleware, configure it and deploy application changes to it. Ansible could be used with GitOps to achieve this. One can use ansible-pull and cron to continuously sync a git repo then with the --only-if-changed/-o flag, execute the changes locally, including the --check works as expected to do a dry-run. 
  - https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-pull.html
  - This should be on each VM which needs to be managed by ansible.
- AWS batch with fargate can be used to run the terraform binary which performs the apply and updates the state. It can also be a small EC2 instance with state backed up after each run. Appropriate IAM permissions can be assigned to the AWS EC2 or fargate similar to cloudformation iam permissions. State needs to be stored in the same account so that if account is deleted, state is also deleted.
- Liquibase binary daemon can be a process on the database machine.
- binary daemon process should be as close to the deployment endpoint as possible and traffic should not go over the internet. It should be in the same VPC or same cloud.
- If one reconcilation takes time, any more updates to the GitOps repository will have to wait for the previous reconcilation to finish.
- Every reconcilation will fix the drift if one exists due to manual changes.
- Wait for reconcilation to finish before Jenkins updates the GitOps repository because contract testing results for to be deployed component may change after reconcilation of a component.
- GitOps features
  * Automated deployment of applications to specified target environments
  * Support for multiple config management/templating tools (Kustomize, Helm, Jsonnet, plain-YAML)
  * Ability to manage and deploy to multiple clusters
  * SSO Integration (OIDC, OAuth2, LDAP, SAML 2.0, GitHub, GitLab, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
  * Multi-tenancy and RBAC policies for authorization
  * Rollback/Roll-anywhere to any application configuration committed in Git repository
  * Health status analysis of application resources
  * Automated configuration drift detection and visualization
  * Automated or manual syncing of applications to its desired state
  * Web UI which provides real-time view of application activity
  * CLI for automation and CI integration
  * Webhook integration (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab)
  * Access tokens for automation
  * PreSync, Sync, PostSync hooks to support complex application rollouts (e.g.blue/green & canary upgrades)
  * Audit trails for application events and API calls
  * Prometheus metrics
  * Parameter overrides for overriding helm parameters in Git
- Better to use Helm template -> Kubernetes yaml since Helm version change may make some changes to the Kubernetes yaml. We are tracking helm charts in source code repository. We can track what changes helm made in kubernetes yaml in GitOps repository. How will Helm hooks work ? Should we use argocd hooks ?
- ArgoCD application 
  - GitOps repository : one per organizational unit
  - Target revision :
    - HEAD
    - branch : one branch per environment like component, integrated, e2e, performance, production and dr of the organizational unit
    - tag
  - Path : one per component which has source code repository
  - Destination : one per kubernetes cluster of each environment account of organizational unit
  - Namespace : one per environment of the organizational unit if multiple environments share the same kubernetes cluster. 
    - We can have 4 accounts : 
      - component, integrated and e2e combined into one : any change in kubernetes cluster will affect all 3 environments
      - performance
      - production
      - dr 
    - OR we can have 6 accounts and 6 kubernetes clusters.
- GitOps should also be used to managed DevOps Resources
  - When new component is added, compass should add the new component terraform infrastructure code in GitOps repository of each organizational unit where required.
  - Terraform running in each account like DevOps account, environment account should keep the DevOps infrastructure as code in sync with the GitOps repository. 
  - So if tomorrow, we need to make some changes to all the DevOps resources, it can be done by just updating the GitOps repository. 
  - Examples of DevOps resources are CI/CD pipelines, artifact repositories, source code repositories, sonarqube projects, argocd applications, etc.
- CD should merge all the configuration values and create terraform.tfvars.json and download all required terraform modules and create terraform module files for each environment account for each component.
- Use opentofu instead of terraform
- Use https://flux-iac.github.io/tofu-controller/use-tf-controller/ with fluxcd GitOps
- Steps
  - Create management account
  - Use terraform to create vpc and ec2 instance in management account. This infrastructure code will be added later to examplebank gitops repository.
  - ec2 instance should have all the terraform code to bootstrap the management account like  
    - create organization examplebank. This infrastructure code will be added later to examplebank gitops repository.
    - create organizational unit devops. This infrastructure code will be added later to examplebank gitops repository. Each organizational unit will have multiple accounts for each environment. So we cannot assign the infrastructure code to create organizational unit to any one account. It will be added to organization gitops repository.
    - create aws accounts for different environments (component, integration, e2e, performance, production, dr) of the devops organizational unit. This infrastructure code will be added later to examplebank gitops repository. We cannot assign the infrastructure code to create accounts to any one organizational unit account. It will be added to organization gitops repository. 
    - create vpc and ec2 instance in each account
    - devops account ec2 instance should have all the terraform code to bootstrap the each account like
      - create vpc and eks cluster. This infrastructure code will be added later to devops gitops repository account branch.
      - configure github. This infrastructure code will be added later to devops-github repository.
      - When eks cluster is created, argocd will be installed to it. It will start looking at devops gitops repository account branch.
  - For security, only CI pipeline tool like jenkins should be able to write to the GitOps repositories. Better to have single EC2 instance with both Jenkins and GitOps repositories so that only Jenkins which is on the same instance as the GitOps repositories can write to the GitOps repositories. Use GitBucket for the GitOps repository. Also https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-server/, https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-server-plugin is a good option.
  - Checkin code to install jenkins and configure it will devops-jenkins job in devops gitops repository account branch. 
  - Create devops-jenkins repository which will trigger devops-jenkins CI/CD pipeline and configure examplebank, devops and devops-github jobs.
  - Create examplebank, devops and devops-github repositories.
- examplebank organization for storing source code. examplebank-gitops organization for storing gitops code. Avoid monorepo because it leads to unnecessary commits to the component gitops repository, we can have unlimited repositories, less secure because multiple applications share the same git repo.
  - One repository per component
  - One branch per environment like component, integration, e2e, performance, production, dr
  - One directory per public cloud account like aws, azure, gcp, oracle containing cloud iac
  - One directory per kubernetes cluster containing kubernetes iac.
  - One deploy key per repository. Do not use personal access tokens with fine grained tokens since it is in beta. devops-github Terraform should add the public key to the github repository and add the private key as a secret which should be available to argocd via ~/.ssh/config https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#using-multiple-repositories-on-one-server
- Use below annotation and github webhooks to ensure that application cache is invalidated only if files in the directory in which application resides are changed.
  - argocd.argoproj.io/manifest-generate-paths: .
- 3 Jenkins EC2 Master Controller instances with EFS mounted with write permissions. 3 EC2 Instances with EFS mounted with read permission containing git server. OR One gitops repository per organizational unit in Github. Only Jenkins Instances have write permission using short lived tokens. Argocd and terraform have only read permission using short lived tokens.
  - Better to use Github for gitops repositories instead of git on a server for SLSA compliance. https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/113838
- We could upload kubernetes manifests to helm oci repositories and use helm as source for ArgoCD. But then, anyone who can push to the helm oci repository will be able to make changes to the container image or helm charts. So it is same problem as git repositories. So better to just create git repository with one branch per environment for terraform iac and kubernetes iac.
- For security reasons, disable kustomize, helm and jsonnet tools since developers may refer to dependant charts and hack the system. Better to just use Jenkins CI to convert helm charts to kubernetes yamls and store final yamls in GitOps repository.
- Export Kubernetes ArgoCD events to permanent storage for auditing.
- Add Admission controller in Kubernetes for SLSA verification of container images.
- Create argocd-repo-server-tls secret and add --repo-server-strict-tls parameter to argocd-application-controller pods. In case of service mesh sidecar container, disable to TLS

  - https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/tls/#configuring-tls-to-argocd-repo-server
  - https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/tls/#disabling-tls-to-argocd-repo-server
- App of Apps pattern. Not required, organizational unit infrastructure as code terraform modules deployed using Terraform GitOps created by Jenkins should find the organizational unit components from github repositories and then create terraform kubernetes yaml argocd application resources for them in the argocd namespace. Add resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io finalizer to the argocd application.

- Set up network policies to prevent direct access to Argo CD components (Redis and the repo-server). Make sure your cluster supports those network policies and can actually enforce them.
- Secrets
  - Use Cloud provider secrets manager like AWS secrets manager for providing secrets to cloud resources since it can be integrated with Cloud IAM.
  - Use DAPR for secret management inside kubernetes
  - For secret management for EC2 instances use iam role to get secrets from aws secrets manager.
  - The application which needs the secret for connecting to it like DBMS should rotate the secret and update the aws secrets manager. Not the other way around. Cron scripts can be defined for it. 
  - Both the old and new secret should be valid till the app start using the new secret.
  - One secret can be shared by multiple components. Need to add tags on the secret and iam role should use tags to select which secrets should be available to components.
  - IAM roles should be used by AWS components to connect to other AWS components like AWS RDS.
  - IAM roles should be used to get client id and secret from secret manager and then use that to get short lived OIDC tokens from IDP like Okta to connect to IDP compliant applications.
  - No passwords or long living tokens should be used for communication.
  - DAPR mTLS and access policies for connecting to other kubernetes services and IAM role service account to connect to aws services outside kubernetes.
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/gitops-quality-life-tips
  - https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_tracking/#choosing-a-tracking-method
- Dont use webhooks because then we need to install argocd api server and have network connection open from git provider to argocd api server. Better to just wait for configured refresh interval like 10 seconds. CI/CD pipeline can wait 10 seconds after making the change to GitOps repository
- Even though pod was stuck in pending state due to no nodes available, health of the argocd application was progressing because deployment status had desired number of replicas. CI/CD pipeline should check for ArgoCD events like synced and health status as healthy within specified timeout period. If not, then it should override the folder with previous commit which changed files in the folder and create new commit.
- Use an init container for argo-repo-server deployment to get repository credentials and update ~/.ssh/config through volume mounts.
- Set namespace in yaml files. kubectl may not be able to set namespace for crd resources
- Set annotations for both helm hooks and equivalent argocd hooks in helm charts. This way it will work with helm install and also argocd. If only helm hooks are defined in helm charts, use kustomize to set argocd hooks.
  - Make your hook idempotent. They should run only when required. Like post-install should only run once during install.
  - Annotate crd-install with hook-weight: "-2" to make sure it runs to success before any install or upgrade hooks.
  - Annotate pre-install and post-install with hook-weight: "-1". This will make sure it runs to success before any upgrade hooks.
  - Annotate pre-upgrade and post-upgrade with hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation to make sure it runs on every sync.
- No need to use argocd notifications since jenkins ci/cd pipeline should look at kubernetes events for argocd status and after argocd reconcilation is successful and healthy, it should 
  - rollback the commit to GitOps repository
  - fail the CI/CD pipeline
  - run the tests.
- No need to use argocd applicationsets custom resource because we will have different GitOps repository for each component and not a monorepo for all components of an organizational unit. Also, we will use terraform to manage argocd application custom resources in argocd namespace. We will run static tests and policy as code in CI/CD pipeline before committing changes to the GitOps repository.
- When running helm template command set argocd application name as the release name. This is because argocd sets app.kubernetes.io/instance label = argocd application name and if we use this label in the selectors, it can be problematic if they are different.
- Set values explicitly for those generated by randAlphaNum function otherwise helm template will generate different values each time.
- Keep crd chart in a separate subchart folder inside the helm chart folder. Add it is as dependency for the helm chart. 
  - https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/Chart.yaml
  - https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/charts/crds
- Give CRD resources a negative wave number using kustomize to have them deployed before any other resource. Try what happens if we add them as pre-sync hook ( We want crds to be deleted if app is deleted so maybe adding them as pre-sync hook will not work).
- Add a pre-sync hook to wait for the CRD apis to be available before deploying the custom resources.
```
We only install the Prometheus CRDs, AWS ebs csi driver, and the AWS cloud controller provider via kustomize immediately after cluster creation. We use kubeadm on vanilla k8s in AWS.

The way we install Argo and all the other core infra apps is that we create a repo for each app on our hosted Gitlab. Then for each project, we use a script to run helm template command that generates all the manifests, including kustomization, which we commit to the same repo. For Argo CD, these manifests include the read-only deploy keys, projects and self applications.

We use an “apps of apps” approach where we have a “self-argo” app that manages itself and then the “self” app that points to a kustomizion overlay for the cluster that uses the above repositories for all the core services. Things like AWS load balancer controller, kyverno, Prometheus, etc. The overlay does any “last mile” patches, stuff like setting cluster name or AWS region in pod containers environment variables. One of the patches we use is a LabelTransformer that targets all CustomResourceDefinitions and applies an Argo CD wave label with a negative number; this ensures all crds are installed first. The last resource we load is the Argo CD Applications for all the teams who will have access to the cluster which point to their own repository that they manage.

Additionally, we are using kube2iam and iam roles to grant access AWS resources

In ArgoCD, you can configure sync-waves to install first the CRDs and put those resources in a higher sync-wave with the sync option SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true, so that it doesn't fail before applying

### AWS organization management account
- Create AWS account with root user email address examplebank2024@gmail.com and AWS account name examplebank.
- Add MFA to root user.
- Create AWS IAM user with name administrator and permissions AdministratorAccess.
- Add MFA to administrator user.

### devops-github code repository
- Use it to create Github repository template with following features.
  - devops, docs and tests directories. ( No need for .github/workflows/docs since docs will be deployed by the CI/CD pipeline in different environments ).
  - release/1.0 branch.
  - devops/configuration folder will have configuration files for component, integrated, e2e, performance, production and dr environments.

### CI/CD pipeline
- Create Github repository devops-jenkins in examplebank organization from the Github repository template.
- It will use packer to create Jenkins virtual machine image.
- It should install all plugins and configure using configuration as code.
- It will create Jenkins virtual machine on Data center (macos virtualization).

### Component catalog
- Create Github repository devops-compass in examplebank organization from the Github repository template.
- devops-github, devops-jenkins and devops-compass components should be created. github repositories for them were created manually. jenkins jobs for them should be created.
- Compass should automatically create github repository and jenkins job for each component created in compass.

### Cloud management platform
- Hashicorp cloud platform for Terraform, Vault, etc.
- Create component devops-hcp in compass.
- Jenkins CI/CD pipelines will use cloudify cli with terraform module blueprints to deploy infrastructure as code to private clouds, public clouds and kubernetes.
- It will use packer to create Cloudify virtual machine image.
- It will create Cloudify virtual machine on Data center (macos virtualization).

### Organization code repository
- Create component examplebank in compass.
- Create terraform module in devops/infrastructure folder to 
  - create AWS organization with name examplebank.
  - enable AWS identity center.
- Create unit tests in tests/unit folder for the terraform module.
- Create temporary shell script in devops/cicd_pipeline folder to 
  - install terraform and terratest.
  - run the unit tests.
  - run the terraform module.
  - update devops/configuration files
- AWS control tower adds a lot of infrastructure whose code is not stored in terraform so we are not using AWS control tower.
- Temporary shell script will be replaced by Jenkins CI/CD pipeline when Jenkins component is installed in devops organizational unit.

### devops organizational unit code repository
- Create component devops in compass.
- Create terraform module in devops/infrastructure folder to 
  - create AWS organizational unit with name devops in AWS organization examplebank.
  - create AWS organization accounts for component, integrated, e2e, performance, production and dr environments of devops organizational unit.
  - service control policies and iam identity center.
  - install infrastructure like aws eks which is common for all components deployed to the devops organizational unit.
- Create unit tests in tests/unit folder for the terraform module.
- Create temporary shell script in devops/cicd_pipeline folder to 
  - install terraform and terratest.
  - run the unit tests.
  - run the terraform module.
  - update devops/configuration files
- AWS control tower adds a lot of infrastructure whose code is not stored in terraform so we are not using AWS control tower.
- Temporary shell script will be replaced by Jenkins CI/CD pipeline when Jenkins component is installed in devops organizational unit.

### Configuration
- Configuration should be stored in devops/configuration of examplebank organization, devops organizational unit, jenkins and other components.
- CI/CD pipeline should package these and push to artifact repository
- CI/CD pipeline should deploy these configurations to configuration management component like Hashicorp Vault during the deployment to respective environment.
- When the application starts, it should download this configuration according to authentication and authorization setup by CI/CD pipeline and merge the configuration with component configuration overwriting the organizational unit configuration which overwrites the organization configuration. 
- Yaml files should be used to store the configuration due to requirements for dictionary and array data structures.

### Secrets
- Components should use keystore and truststore for inter communication authentication and authorization.
- For each environment, they should get their keystore and truststore from secret management component like Hashicorp Vault according to authentication and authorization setup by CI/CD pipeline and use their CA certificate key from keystore and trusted CA certificate keys from truststore to communicate with other components.
- secret management component like Hashicorp Vault is responsible for rotating the CA certificate key.
- Middleware like databases are also components.
- Passwords should only be used if keys are not supported. This is because with keys, you have 2 way authentication and authorization. Server checks if client CA certificate key is in its truststore and client checks if server CA certificate key key is in its truststore. CA certificate keys are rotated from the same CA. CA certificate keys are long and difficult to brute force. Internally the mechanism uses short lived session tokens after initial handshake with the CA certificate keys.
- security organizational unit is responsible for secret management components like Hashicorp Vault.

### Code repository component code repository
- create devops-github component code repository

### artifact repository component code repository
- create devops-nexusrm component code repository

### configuration management and secrets management component code repository
- create security-vault component code repository.
- need to first create security organizational unit code repository and CI/CD pipeline.

### Identify code repository application
- github

### Identify CI/CD pipeline application
- jenkins

### CI/CD pipeline application infrastructure component
- Code repository
  - Create devops-jenkins-infrastructure code repository
  - This will use shell script or github actions to create Jenkins executables, archives, installers, container images, helm charts and virtual machine images for different operating systems and middlewares. It will install required plugins like configuration as code plugin as part of the image.
  - This will use shell script or github actions to create Jenkins infrastructure and configure it using configuration as code
- CI/CD pipeline
  - It will also create devops-jenkins-infrastructure CI/CD pipeline

### Code repository application infrastructure component
- Code repository
  - Create devops-github-infrastructure code repository
- CI/CD pipeline
  - Update devops-jenkins-infrastructure code repository to create devops-github-infrastructure CI/CD pipeline

### Identify ITSM with ITAM/CMDB/Component catalog application
- Jira service management (jsm) with Atlassian compass (component catalog)
- ITSM is has all features of helpdesk and servicedesk and more features so organizational unit for the application is itsm.
  - https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/service-request-management/help-desk-vs-service-desk-vs-itsm
- Atlassian compass
  - https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/compass/overview/what-is-compass/
- Affected services in Jira service management are synced with Atlassian compass components
  - https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/synchronize-your-services-with-compass/

### ITAM/CMDB/Component catalog application infrastructure component
- Code repository
  - Update devops-github-infrastructure code repository to create itsm-compass-infrastructure code repository
- CI/CD pipeline
  - Update devops-jenkins-infrastructure code repository to create itsm-compass-infrastructure CI/CD pipeline
- add custom fields like organizational unit and application to compass settings -> custom fields.

### Components code repository and CI/CD pipeline
- For each component added to Atlassian compass, devops-github-infrastructure and devops-jenkins-infrastructure CI/CD pipelines should create corresponding code repository and CI/CD pipeline.
- Events or webhooks
