## 3. Application Engineering ( a.k.a Development )
Responsibilities:
- Add features to application.
- Solve non production environment bugs.
- unit testing

From CI/CD pipeline perspective, there are 3 types of applications:
- Applications which are released to customers so that customers can deploy them to their own environments. 
    - Examples are Windows, Ubuntu, React, Angular, JDK, Kubernetes, Apache Tomcat, Apache Maven, Selenium, Postman, OWASP Zap, etc.
    - Output of the CI/CD pipeline is a release version.
    - Released artifacts are executables, archives, installers, container images and virtual machine images for different operating systems and middlewares.
- Applications which are deployed to production environment
    - Examples are examplebank account, transfer, loan, card, atm, currency, fees microservice application components.
    - Output of the CI/CD pipeline is deployment of application code artifacts to production environment.
    - If customers own the code, the CI pipeline will build and package the code otherwise it will take it from the artifacts released from the first type of applications.
- SaaS Applications which are configured
    - Examples are Salesforce CRM.
    - Output of CI/CD pipeline is deployment of configuration and custom code artifacts to SaaS provider's application endpoints.
    - From the perspective of the SaaS organization, output of CI/CD pipeline is a release version, and for each customer onboarded to the SaaS application, separate instance of the application is deployed to production environment.

<br/><br/>

## 8. Customer account management
- In case of applications released as products, liason between customer who has deployed the application or using it as a service and different internal teams.

<br/><br/>

## Application code repositories for platform tools
- Discovery : 
    - Fill a questionnaire for each application component to collect the data. Then, use the data to make recommendations for the tools of various platforms. 
    - Use GenAI to scan all the application components code repositories and make recommendations for the tools of various platforms.
- Implementation : 
    - Based on the recommendations, we need to create code repositories for these tools in the appropriate organization
    - For example, if recommended middleware tool is apache tomcat because some application components are deployed to apache tomcat as war archives, then we need to create code repository for apache_tomcat application component of apache_tomcat application of middleware organizational unit. 
        - It will have release branches for each major release of apache_tomcat which has been release by apache. 
        - CI/CD pipeline will get the artifacts from apache and create executables, archives, installers, container images and virtual machine images for different operating systems and middlewares.
